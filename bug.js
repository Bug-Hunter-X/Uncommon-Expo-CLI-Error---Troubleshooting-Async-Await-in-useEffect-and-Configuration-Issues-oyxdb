This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo start` command and is often linked to issues with your project's configuration or dependencies.  The error message itself might not pinpoint the exact cause, but common culprits include problems with your `package.json`, `app.json`, or incorrect usage of Expo modules. One specific scenario involves using async/await within the `useEffect` hook with functions that don't properly handle errors or return promises.
