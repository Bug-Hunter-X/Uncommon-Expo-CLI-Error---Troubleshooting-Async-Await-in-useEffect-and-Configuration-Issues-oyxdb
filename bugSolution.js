The solution involves correctly handling promises returned by async functions within the useEffect hook and ensuring error handling is implemented.  Properly configured `package.json` and `app.json` files are also crucial.  Additionally, making sure all dependencies are correctly installed and versions are compatible is essential.  The updated code includes improved error handling and ensures that promises are awaited properly.  Double check your project's config files for any typos or inconsistencies.
